With all the hubbub about OpenAI's o1 and the strawberry thing I thought I'd try their approach with Claude.  I demo'd it to a friend and they said put it on github so he can share it. So here it is.

I had the output from my test rewritten into markdown by Claude.  Please put an issue in if you find a version of the phrase that doesn't work.

Also, how hard did I work on this? Uh not. I told Claude what I wanted and he wrote the prompts for me, I haven't even read them.  I did add the step by step part on the first step myself.

# Enter your question for Claude: How many letter r are in the word strawberry?

## First response:

Let me think through this step-by-step:

1. First, I'll visualize the word "strawberry" in my mind.
2. Now, I'll go through the word letter by letter, counting the 'r's:
   s-t-r-a-w-b-e-r-r-y
3. I see the first 'r' after 't'.
4. I see two more 'r's near the end of the word.
5. In total, I count 3 'r's in the word "strawberry".

**There are 3 letter r's in the word "strawberry".**

## Second response:

The previous response is correct in its reasoning and conclusion. However, we can improve it by:
1. Being more concise in the reasoning steps.
2. Adding a visual representation of the word with the 'r's highlighted for clarity.
3. Mentioning that 'r' appears only in lowercase, as it's typically written.

**The word "strawberry" contains 3 letter r's.**

Here's a visual representation with the r's highlighted:

st[r]awbe[rr]y

Note that all instances of 'r' in "strawberry" are lowercase.

## Claude's final response:

**There are 3 letter r's in the word "strawberry".**

To visualize this:

st[r]awbe[rr]y

All instances of 'r' in "strawberry" are lowercase. The first 'r' appears after 't', and the other two are found near the end of the word.
